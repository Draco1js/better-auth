- All imports from `@erquhart/convex-better-auth` have been updated to `@convex-dev/better-auth`. Search and replace this across your repo.
- Your framework may work full stack without cross domain - go checkout the installation section for more details.
- AuthFunctions are now passed to the BetterAuth component constructor via the config object.
- The crossDomain plugin now requires a `siteUrl` option.
- The `siteUrl` value will be added to `trustedOrigins` automatically. `trustedOrigins` can be removed if using the cross domain plugin and your site url was the only value.

```diff lang="ts" title="convex/auth.ts"
- import { BetterAuth, type AuthFunctions, convexAdapter } from "@erquhart/convex-better-auth";
- import { convex, crossDomain } from "@erquhart/convex-better-auth/plugins";
+ import { BetterAuth, type AuthFunctions, convexAdapter } from "@convex-dev/better-auth";
+ import { convex, crossDomain } from "@convex-dev/better-auth/plugins";

export const betterAuthComponent = new BetterAuth(
  components.betterAuth,
-   authFunctions,
+   {
+    authFunctions: authFunctions,
+  }
  }
)
export const createAuth = (ctx: GenericCtx) =>
  betterAuth({
-     trustedOrigins: ["http://localhost:3000"],
    database: convexAdapter(ctx, betterAuthComponent),
    plugins: [
      convex(),
-       crossDomain(),
+       crossDomain({
+         siteUrl: "http://localhost:3000",
+       }),
    ],
  });
